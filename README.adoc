== Goals

- [x] Implement basic world generation.
- [ ] Implement basic _laws of nature_
- [ ] Develop feature set for creatures
- [ ] Look into and implement https://towardsdatascience.com/neat-an-awesome-approach-to-neuroevolution-3eca5cc7930f[NEAT]

== Usage

Run `lein fig:dev` in your terminal. Wait for a while until you see `Successfully compiled "target/public/cljs-out/biosphere-main.js"`.

You can use this while developing your sketch. Whenever you save your source files the browser will automatically refresh everything, providing you with quick feedback. .

== Publishing your sketch

Before you publish your sketch, run `lein do clean, fig:publish`. This will compile your code and run Google Closure Compiler with advanced optimizations. Take `resources/public/index.html` and `target/public/cljs-out/biosphere-main.js` and upload them to server of your choice.
